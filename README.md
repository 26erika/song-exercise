# Bohemian Rhapsody
### Queen

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go



------- 13 --------
Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows
