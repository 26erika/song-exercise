# Bohemian Rhapsody
### Queen

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go

------- 5 --------
Mama, oh oh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

------- 7 --------
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
